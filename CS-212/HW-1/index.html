    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Edumon</h3>
    <p>For this project, I created Edumon, a complex full-stack turn-based RPG where players collect and battle monsters
        by answering educational questions to determine the success of their moves. I used React Native for the
        frontend, implemented async storage for managing game state and user progression, and added subject and
        difficulty customization to tailor the learning experience. The app also includes animations, audio integration,
        and pixel art visuals to provide a seamless, engaging experience.</p>

    <h3>Culinary Showdown</h3>
    <p>This game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and encompasses all of the topics I have learned in my first
        semester of West-MEC. It is a typing/adventure game (mostly) complete with audio, interactivity, and just a few
        bugs. It utilizes the JS canvas, eventlisteners, inputs, arrays, and loops which append elements to the DOM.
        This is just scraping the surface of what this game covers, but I plan to make my projects more in-depth and
        entertaining in the future.</p>

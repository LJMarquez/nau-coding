define calculate mass percentage function and pass through the count array, nucleotide string as parameters
    set the junk count equal to the the length of the nucleotide string - the sum of all the nucleotide counts

    set mass a to the nucleotide count of a * it's mass
    set mass c to the nucleotide count of a * it's mass
    set mass g to the nucleotide count of a * it's mass
    set mass t to the nucleotide count of a * it's mass

    set the total mass equal to all the sum of all the masses and round to one decimal place

    set a percentage to the (mass of a / the total mass) * 100 and round to one decimal place
    set c percentage to the (mass of c / the total mass) * 100 and round to one decimal place
    set g percentage to the (mass of g / the total mass) * 100 and round to one decimal place
    set t percentage to the (mass of t / the total mass) * 100 and round to one decimal place

    return an array of all the mass percentages, and the total mass

define get codons function and pass through the nucleotide string as a parameter
    use for loop to go over each nucleotide in the nucleotide string
        if the nucleotide isn't a "-"
            add the nucleotide to a temporary codon
            if the temporary codon's length is == 3
                append it to the codons list
                clear the temporary codon
    
    return the codon list

define is Protein function and pass through codon list, nucleotide count list, and total mass as parameters
    set the c and g mass equal to the (sum of c count and g count / the total mass) * 100

    if the length of the codons list is at least 5 AND the first codon == "ATG" AND the last codon is either "TAA", "TAG", or "TGA" AND the c and g mass percentage is greater than 30
        return "YES"
    else
        return "NO"
